Hello everybody. Welcome to Week 3!

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.460
This is my favorite part of the course as we are going to work

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.820
with graphics. You will learn to

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.820
draw simple shapes into the new HTML5 canvas

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.180
elements. We will see along many examples

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.680
how to draw lines, curves, circles,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.430
arcs, images, how to fill shapes with

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.490
textures, patterns, repetitive patterns

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.580
with gradiants, how to add shadows

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.350
and so on. The course comes with many small examples,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.400
so do not be afraid by its length.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.930
This time the course is long but there is no major difficulties in it.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.210
You will also learn a lot of good practices.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.650
You will learn how to use geometric transformations,

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.930
how to make a responsive canvas, and how to write

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.010
a multiple image loader and this is a bit

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.310
the tricky part usually for beginners.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.870
The canvas API is simple but rich, and this week covers

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.909
all the things you need to draw graphics.

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.120
I hope you enjoyed the course so far and I'll meet you next week

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.159
for a very funny part that is about animation.
