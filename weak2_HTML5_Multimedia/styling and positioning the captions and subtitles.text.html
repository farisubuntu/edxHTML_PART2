  Styling and positioning the captions/subtitles


    Online example used in this section

In this section, we will look at different possibilities for positioning
and styling the text displayed as captions/subtitles while playing a video.

This example on JS Bin [http://jsbin.com/lopudu/8/edit?html,output]
<http://jsbin.com/lopudu/8/edit?html,output> shows how we can do that
(look at the HTML in JS Bin):

And here is the WebVTT file. Notice the new attributes that have been
added on the right end of the duration values:

 1. WEBVTT
 2.
 3. 00:00:01.000-->00:00:05.000
 4. Thesecaptions test some features of the WebVTTformats
 5.
 6. 00:00:06.000-->00:00:10.000*line:5%*
 7. Thiscue ispositioned at the top of the video
 8.
 9. 00:00:11.000-->00:00:15.000*position:5%align:start*
10. Thiscue ispositioned at the left side of the video.
11.
12. 00:00:16.000-->00:00:20.000position:95%*align:end*
13. Andthisone ate the right side.
14.
15. 00:00:21.000-->00:00:25.000*size:33%*
16. Thiscue isonly a third of the width of the video,hence the multiple
    line breaks.
17.
18. 00:00:26.000-->00:00:30.000
19. Thiscue contains *<b>*bold*</b>*text.
20.
21. 00:00:31.000-->00:00:35.000
22. Thiscue contains *<i>*italic*</i>*text.
23.
24. 00:00:36.000-->00:00:40.000
25. Thiscue contains *<u>*underlined*</u>*text.
26.
27. 00:00:41.000-->00:00:45.000
28. Thiscue contains *<b><i><u>*bold,italic,underlined*</u></i></b>*text.
29.
30. 00:00:46.000-->00:00:50.000
31. *<c.myclass>*Thiscue contains the class"myclass".
32. Browsersthat support ::cue CSS should make it red.*</**c>*
33.
34. 00:00:51.000-->00:00:55.000
35. Thefollowing cue contains two voices.
36. Tarzanshould be blue andJanegreen.
37.
38. 00:00:56.000-->00:01:00.000
39. <v Tarzan>MeTarzan...
40. <v Jane>Thatwould make me Jane!
41.
42. bigtext
43. 00:01:01.000-->00:01:05.000
44. Thiscue has a unique id.
45. UsingCSS,its font size should be 150%.
46.
47. 00:01:06.000-->00:01:10.000
48. The<00:01:06.333>text
    <00:01:06.666>in<00:01:07.000>this<00:01:07.333>cue
    <00:01:07.666>should <00:01:08.000>grow
49. <00:01:08.333>one <00:01:08.666>word <00:01:09.000>at
    <00:01:09.333>a <00:01:09.666>time
50.
51. 00:01:11.000-->00:01:15.000
52. That's it! For now...


    How to Position the subtitles

It is possible to locate the cues in the video viewport using absolute
or relative values. The attributes that position the text are located on
the same line as the cue definition, like at line 9 of the previous
WebVTT example file:

 1. 00:00:11.000-->00:00:15.000*position:5%align:start*
 2. Thiscue ispositioned at the left side of the video.

There are several possible values:

      o *line:5%* means "vertical position at a line 5% of the height of
        the video viewport (it will be located at the top of the video,
        proportional to its vertical size).
      o *position:5% align:start* means "regular location at the bottom
        of the video, the start of the sentence will be located at 5% of
        the width of the video", i.e., near the left side.
      o *position:95% align:end* means "regular location at the bottom
        of the video, the end of the sentence will be at 95% of the
        horizontal width of the video".
      o *size:33%* The size of each line will be one third of the size
        of the video. Since the sentence won't fit, it will be displayed
        in multiple lines.

And so on. Please look at the video as it is self-explanatory.


    Using CSS classes for styling

It is possible to style using CSS classes as part of a cue value,
using the <c> element. You can specify the CSS class that should be
applied by adding "." followed by the name of your CSS class. Here is an
example:

 1. <c.myclass>This cue contains the class "myclass".
 2. Browsers that support ::cue CSS should make it red.</c>

CSS rules used in this example:

 1. <styletype="text/css">
 2.      ::cue(.myclass){color:red;}
 3.      ::cue(v[voice="Tarzan"]){color:blue;}
 4.      ::cue(v[voice="Jane"]){color:green;}
 5.      ::cue(#bigtext){font-size:150%;}
 6. </style>

The ::cue pseudo element selector is used to match "cues" in the webVTT
file. You add parenthesis and a secondary CSS selector to match cues
that have a particular id, or a particular CSS class, etc. Look at the
CSS above and at the extract from the webVTT file, play the video, you
will understand how this works...

Support differs from one browser to another, see this compatibility
table <http://www.jwplayer.com/html5/webvtt/> for more info. Notice that
most of the enhanced players presented further on in the course will
provide full support.


    Using voicing for styling: the <v> element

Screenshot taken at 1:02 of this example online
[http://www.jwplayer.com/html5/webvtt/]
<http://www.jwplayer.com/html5/webvtt/>:

Using the <v> tag, you will distinguish different voices that should be
displayed in different colors (depending on the HTML5 video player
implementation). See the CSS presented in the previous section to see
how to specify the colors for the different voices.

Extract from the source code:

 1. 00:00:56.000-->00:01:04.000
 2. <v Tarzan>MeTarzan...
 3. <v Jane>Thatwould make me Jane!
