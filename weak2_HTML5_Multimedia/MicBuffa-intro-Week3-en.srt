Hello everybody. Welcome to Week 3!

1
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,460
This is my favorite part of the course as we are going to work

2
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,820
with graphics. You will learn to

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,820
draw simple shapes into the new HTML5 canvas

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,180
elements. We will see along many examples

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,680
how to draw lines, curves, circles,

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,430
arcs, images, how to fill shapes with

7
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,490
textures, patterns, repetitive patterns

8
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,580
with gradiants, how to add shadows

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,350
and so on. The course comes with many small examples,

10
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,400
so do not be afraid by its length.

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,930
This time the course is long but there is no major difficulties in it.

12
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,210
You will also learn a lot of good practices.

13
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,650
You will learn how to use geometric transformations,

14
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,930
how to make a responsive canvas, and how to write

15
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,010
a multiple image loader and this is a bit

16
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,310
the tricky part usually for beginners.

17
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:14,870
The canvas API is simple but rich, and this week covers

18
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,909
all the things you need to draw graphics.

19
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:23,120
I hope you enjoyed the course so far and I'll meet you next week

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,159
for a very funny part that is about animation.
