  <h3>Labs Overview</h3>
<p>This module of the course includes a series of four tutorial style labs and one self-assessment lab.&nbsp;Some lab configuration is required.</p>
<p>The tutorial labs&nbsp;are designed to&nbsp;teach you how to&nbsp;build a foundational layout for your page based on information provided in wireframe designs. These labs will lead you step-by-step through the process of creating your layout, providing you with both written instructions and an explanation&nbsp;of what you are accomplishing.</p>
<p>The final lab in this module is a self-assessment lab. In this lab, you will apply what you've learned during the tutorial labs to implement the design presented&nbsp;in wireframe diagrams for desktop and mobile devices. The self-assessment lab gives you the&nbsp;opportunity to reinforce what you learned without providing the prescriptive step-by-step instructions that are provided in the tutorial labs.</p>
<h4>Tutorial Labs&nbsp;</h4>
<ol><ol>
<li>
<p>Planning and Designing a Layout</p>
<p>It's important to be able to look at the design of a website and start to plan how you would build a layout with CSS. Thinking about the possible issues up front can save you time and cause less issues over the course of the project. In this&nbsp;lab you will review some website designs and use that review to plan your layout.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build a Semantic HTML and CSS Foundation</p>
<p>In this lab, you will implement&nbsp;a CSS Reset that&nbsp;defines some base styles&nbsp;and provides a consistent foundation for your web page across browsers. You will also start building our layout based on the wireframe designs that you reviewed in the&nbsp;<em>Planning and Designing a Layout</em> lab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analyze Style Guides to Build Your Base CSS</p>
<p>Now that the foundation&nbsp;for your web site is in place, it's time to build the base&nbsp;CSS. In this lab, you will start&nbsp;by&nbsp;identifying the&nbsp;elements and styles that you&nbsp;should add to the base. After that you will create base styles for body, headings, and other elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Media Queries to Create a Responsive Grid System</p>
<p>With your Base CSS in place, it's time to start&nbsp;making your page&nbsp;responsive. In this lab, you will add containers, rows, and columns to your page and then implement a responsive solution that will flip columns when the window displaying your page changes size.</p>
